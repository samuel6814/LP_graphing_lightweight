# LP Grapher

**Open-source interactive linear programming course with KaTeX explainers, LP graphing, and step-by-step solvers — built for MATH 466 Optimization II.**

**Live demo:** [https://lp-graph-six.vercel.app](https://lp-graph-six.vercel.app)

LP Grapher is a browser-based learning app for **MATH 466 — Optimization II** (Linear Programming) at KNUST. It turns the course curriculum into structured topic pages with rendered math, practice questions, and built-in tools so students, self-learners, and educators can study LP graphically and algebraically without installing anything.

The curriculum is derived from the MATH 466 course materials (`MATH 466.pdf` in this repo). Content is organized into five modules covering foundations, graphical methods, the simplex method, duality, and applications.

## Features

### Learn Hub

- **21 topics** across **5 modules** — Introduction, Graphical Methods, Simplex, Duality & Sensitivity, and LP Applications
- **Search** across topic titles, summaries, and quick answers
- **Progress tracking** — mark topics complete; progress persists in `localStorage` (`lp-grapher-progress`)
- Module-grouped topic cards with completion indicators

### Topic pages

- **KaTeX-rendered math** for explainers, equations, and practice
- **Quick answer** summaries at the top of each topic for fast review
- **Practice questions** with expandable solutions
- **FAQ sections** with structured data for search engines
- **Prev/next navigation** between topics in the same module
- **Topic-specific graph presets** — open the tools dock with constraints or functions pre-loaded

### Graphing tool

- Plot **explicit** (`y = f(x)`), **implicit** (`F(x,y) = 0`), and **auto-detected** expressions
- **LP mode** — enter constraints and an objective; visualize feasible regions, isoprofit lines, and optimal corners
- Adjustable axis scale (x/y min/max, step) with reset
- **Export** graph as SVG or PNG
- **State persistence** — expressions, scale, and LP config saved to `localStorage`
- **Mobile-friendly** — fullscreen graph dock on tablet/phone with scrollable controls

### Calculator and step-by-step solver

- **Scientific calculator** with expression evaluation (mathjs)
- **Step-by-step solver** panel for worked solution paths on practice problems
- Global **tools dock** available on every learn page (Graph · Calc · Solver tabs)

### UX and accessibility

- **Light / dark / system** theme toggle with persistence
- Responsive layout from mobile through desktop
- Body scroll lock while the graph tab is open so interaction stays inside the tool

### SEO and discoverability

- Auto-generated `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, and `llms.txt` at build time
- JSON-LD structured data (breadcrumbs, FAQ, course info)
- Configurable canonical URL via `VITE_SITE_URL`

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for deploy and SEO follow-up steps.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_SITE_URL` | Optional | Production URL for canonical links, Open Graph, and sitemap. Defaults to `https://lp-graph-six.vercel.app`. Copy [`client/env.production.example`](client/env.production.example) to `client/.env.production` for local production builds. |

No backend or database is required — the app is fully static.

---

## Deploy

Deploy the `client/` directory to Vercel (or any static host). Full instructions: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This is an educational open-source project — fixes, content improvements, and accessibility enhancements are especially appreciated.

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** — keep diffs focused.
3. **Verify** before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run lint
   npm run validate-math
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Open a pull request** with a clear description of what changed and why.

### Adding or editing topics

1. Add metadata in [`client/src/data/topicRegistry.js`](client/src/data/topicRegistry.js) (slug, title, module, summary, optional `defaultGraph`).
2. Add content in [`client/src/data/topics/`](client/src/data/topics/) — see existing topics for the section/paragraph/math block format.
3. Update [`docs/curriculum-outline.md`](docs/curriculum-outline.md) if the curriculum list changes.
4. Run `npm run validate-math` to catch math rendering issues.
